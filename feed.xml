It has a bunch of interesting new stuff that you can see in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/ManageIQ/projects/13#column-7337345&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. When we announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manageiq.org/blog/2020/03/Announcing-Jansa-Alpha/&quot;&gt;Jansa Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, we highlighted Podification and VMware VimBroker Removal.

        <title>Milestones, Release Cadence, Kasparov</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ManageIQ is getting ready to release an alpha version of the Jansa release.  Additionally, we are moving to a faster release cadence - approximately once every 3 months to keep up with the rate of change of all the providers that ManageIQ interacts with.  We hope to release Jansa GA by June and the K-release by September.  You will notice new milestones in the ManageIQ community to help us keep track of the features being planned for a particular release.  The milestones and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/ManageIQ/projects/13&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; should help keep us all on track!&lt;/p&gt;
