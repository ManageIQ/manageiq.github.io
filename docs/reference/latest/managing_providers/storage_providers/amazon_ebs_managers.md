# Amazon Elastic Block Store Managers

The Amazon Elastic Block Store service provides and manages persistent
block storage resources that Amazon EC2 instances can consume.

To use the Amazon Elastic Block Store service as a storage manager, you
must first add an Amazon EC2 cloud provider to your {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
appliance. The Amazon Elastic Block Store service is automatically
discovered by {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, and added to the **Storage Managers**
list. See [Adding Amazon EC2 Providers](../cloud_providers/amazon_ec2_providers#adding-amazon-ec2-providers) for instructions on adding
an Amazon EC2 cloud provider.
