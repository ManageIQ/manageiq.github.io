# Red Hat Satellite 6

Satellite 6 is a subscription and system management tool that provides a
way to provision hosts (both virtual and bare metal) and configure them
using a set of Puppet modules. {{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides functionality to
integrate with a Red Hat Satellite 6 server and take advantage of its
features. This includes:

  - Monitoring the inventory of your Red Hat Satellite 6 server,
    including independent hosts and hosts provisioned using hostgroups.

  - Reprovisioning existing bare metal system hosts to new host groups.

  - Applying {{ site.data.product.title_short }} policy tags to hosts.

<div class="important">

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} only reprovisions existing systems in a Red Hat
Satellite 6 environment. Provisioning systems from Red Hat Satellite 6â€™s
bare metal discovery service is planned for a future release.
